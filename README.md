# About me

Hi, I’m Andrew McQuillen (https://github.com/atmcq). I am a Senior Engineer and Tech Lead with 20+ years’ experience delivering scalable enterprise SaaS systems. I also have experience in databases, backend systems, and client-facing technical roles.

I like to build impactful software, talk to people and solve problems. 

Most of my code contributions are found in my employer's enterprise GitHub ([it's here](https://github.com/Andrew-McQuillen_civica) if you happen to be a Civican). However if you would like to know more about what I do, my resume is below.
